	<h2>Bio</h2>
	I was born in Derby, England, and my parents moved to France when I was a baby. In the Southwest, in a region called Charente, I grew up learning French at school, and English at home. 
	During my childhood I quickly became fascinated by nature, and spent most of my free time playing outdoors, in the woods and by the village river with my brothers and friends. 
	At school I was mostly interested in scientific subjects, and passed my baccalaureat with the option Science and "specialite" physics & chemistry. I then switched to Biology, and 
	after looking at curriculums I chose to go to Orleans, which has some cool organismal courses in undergrad. This then peaked my interest in Ecology, and I moved back closer to home in Bordeaux,
	after a break outside of school. This stint doing manual labour in a factory rekindled my interest in studying. 
	I then started a Masters in Ecology, with a focus on terrestrial ecosystems. In my first year I went to England for a 2 month internship, with Guillaume Besnard, working on the genetic divergences 
	between populations of the olive tree around the Meditteranean. We also determined haplotypes of invasive olives in Australia to reconstruct the invasion.
	Then for my second year, I started working on the resistance to drought of conifers, with Sylvain Delzon, in his <a href="http://sylvain-delzon.com/" target="_blank">lab</a> in Bordeaux.
	Here I deepened my knowledge in plant water relations, and vairous methods to measure the hydraulic status of a plant. I worked on expanding measurements of embolism resistance with Herve Cochard's
	Cavitron method. Conifers are group of gymnosperms, of around 650 species in 7 different families. Over their ~350 milion year history, they are a diverse group found all over the globe in a wide 
	range of habitats. Many are adapted to xeric environments, and we started finding intriguing results. In my first internship, we described the wide variation of embolism resistance, with Pinaceae 
	typically more vulnerable, and some Cupressaceae and Podocarpaceae more resistant. In my second internship, we found that P<sub>50</sub> displays strong phylogenetic signal in Pinaceae, along with 
	other results suggesting some level of evolutionary conservatism in this family. These results helped us to formulate questions that led to the subject of my PhD.
	How has drought resistance evolved throughout conifers? To answer this question, we expanded the database of embolism resistance, with species from all families, and around 90% of the ~75 genera. 
	Of great interest for me were genera of Cupressaceae, notably the Australian <i>Callitris</i>, which had previously been identified as extraordinarily drought resistant. We therefore started a 
	collaboration with some Australian colleagues, Sebastian Pfautsch in Sydney and <i>Callitris</i> expert Tim Brodribb. I obtained a grant to travel to Australia to sample the remaining species, 
	and discovered back in the lab some record resistant species, <i>Callitris canescens</i> and <i>Callitris tuberculata</i>. <br/>
	The anthocyanin pathway is the major source of floral pigments in plants. It is responsible for most purples, blues, reds, and pinks in your garden. At the core of this biochemical
	pathway, 7 genes encode 7 enzymatic steps that transform precursors into different types of anthocyanins. Determining which branch of the pathway is active are the branching genes 
	<i>F3'h</i> and <i>F3'5'h</i>, which are largely responsible for the floral hue. If both are inactive, the result will be the red pelargonidin based pigments. If only <i>F3'5'h</i> is off,
	the results are cyanidin-based pigments. Finally, if both are turned on, the results will be blue-purple delphinidin-based pigments. In this case as you can see, the genetic determinism 
	of the trait - floral pigmentations - is relatively straightforward. However, the modality of character switch, say delphinidin to cyanidin, is unknown in most natural evolutionary (i.e. in 
	natural species and populations. In the first part of my project, we found that in the Solanaceae tribe Iochrominae, the ancestral state, blue delphinidin anthocyanins has been lost, with multiple 
	lineages having lost pigmentation totally. This character change was the result of severe down-expression of the 3 latest core genes, <i>F3'5'h</i>, <i>Dfr</i>, and <i>Ans</i>.
	After my PhD I moved across the pond to Colorado (USA), and started a post-doc with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/smithlab/" target="_blank">Stacey Smith</a> at CU Boulder.
	Here I explored something that I was thinking about previously for a while: how are phenotypes determined by genes and their expression?
