	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>I was born in Derby (UK), and my parents moved to France when I was a baby. I grew up in a region called the Charente in the Southwest and I learned French at school and English at home. During my childhood I quickly became fascinated by nature, and spent most of my free time playing outdoors, in the woods and by the local river with my brothers and friends. All through school I was mostly interested in science, in particular biology.</p> <br/>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>My <b>undergrad</b> was in organismal biology, and after a stint working in a factory which rekindled my interest in academia, I started a Masters in Ecology in Bordeaux. During my first year, I went to England for a 2 month internship with Guillaume Besnard, working on the genetics of the olive complex across the Meditteranean Bassin. We also determined haplotypes of invasive olives in Australia, to reconstruct the history of the invasion. Then during my second year, I started working on conifers drought resistance, in Sylvain Delzon's <a href="http://sylvain-delzon.com/" target="_blank">lab</a> in Bordeaux.
	There I deepened my knowledge of plant water relations and various methods to measure the water status of a plant. I worked mainly on measurements of embolism resistance with Herve Cochard's Cavitron method. Conifers, a group of 615 species of gymnosperms (in 7 different families), are a diverse group found all over the globe in a wide range of habitats. Many are adapted to xeric or cold environments. In my first internship, we described the wide variation of embolism resistance across conifer species, with members of Pinaceae typically more vulnerable, and some Cupressaceae and Podocarpaceae more resistant to drought. In my second internship, we found that P<sub>50</sub> displays strong phylogenetic signal in Pinaceae, along with other results suggesting some level of evolutionary conservatism in this family.</p> <br/> 
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>These results helped us to formulate questions that led to my <b>PhD</b>. We were interested in how drought resistance (through embolism resistance) evolved across all conifers. To answer this question, we expanded our database of conifer embolism resistance to species belonging all families and around 90% of the ~75 genera. The Cupressaceae family was of great interest to me, notably the Australian & New Caledonian genus <i>Callitris</i>, which had previously been identified as drought-adapted. Through a collaboration with some colleagues Down-under (i.e. Sebastian Pfautsch in Sydney and <i>Callitris</i> expert Tim Brodribb at UTas), I obtained a grant to travel to Australia. After sampling among wild populations of the remaining 15 species, we discovered some record resistant species, namely <i>Callitris canescens</i> and <i>Callitris tuberculata</i> (P<sub>50</sub> of -16.8 and -18.8 MPa, respectively). <br/>
	At a broader evolutionary scale, we found an evolutionary association between narrower inter-tracheid pits and increased embolism resistance. In a separate thesis chapter, we identified shifts in the rate of evolution of this trait early within the <i>Callitris</i> and <i>Cupressus</i>-<i>Juniperus</i> clades, which also coincide with an uptick in clade diversification rate (still unpublished...).</p> <br/>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>To fully understand trait evolution, it is often crucial to know the genetic basis for a trait and the mechanisms that lead to shifts within phenotypic space. To explore these questions further, and to get a better grasp on comparative methods and evolutionary convergence, I moved to Colorado (USA), and started a <b>post-doc</b> with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/smithlab/" target="_blank">Stacey Smith</a> at CU Boulder. Here I'm working on the evolution of the anthocyanin pathway in Iochrominae, a group of South American Solanaceae. In the first part of my project, we found that in this tribe, the ancestral state blue delphinidin anthocyanins has been lost several times, with multiple lineages having lost pigmentation totally. This character change was the result of severe down-expression of the 3 latest core genes, <i>F3'5'h</i>, <i>Dfr</i>, and <i>Ans</i>. Further investigations are under way, using transcriptomics to understand how these genes are downregulated. <br/>
	We also found that within polymorphic species, other things were happening. Unpigmented flowers are sometimes produced while these late pathway genes are normally expressed. This provides support for the hypothesis that non-regulatory mutations with higher pleiotropic effects can exist within populations but over longer time periods tend to be filtered out by selection. This species-level mutational "funnel" results in a bias at broader evolutionary scales, creating a pattern with convergence in molecular and/or genetic mechanisms in cases of phenotypic convergent evolution.</p>
