Max Larter's website

Hi,
This is the github repo for my personnal / professional website. I don't have much skill at all this, and not very much time to develop it either. 
I hope to get more things up soon (today is Jan 30 2019, for reference!) like fieldwork photos and stuff (maybe some blogging?).
Anyway, thanks for reading!
Max.
