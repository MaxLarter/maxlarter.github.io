Max Larter's website

Hi,
This is the github repo for my personnal / professional website. I don't have much skill at all this, and not very much time to develop it either. 
I hope to get more things up soon (today is Jan 30 2019, for reference!) like fieldwork photos and stuff (maybe some blogging?).
Anyway, thanks for reading!
Max.

I "borrowed" code from Auriel Fournier's website source code, hosted on github here: https://aurielfournier.github.io/. Both of us used Barry Clark's posts about making a website/blog using Jekyll and github pages. His work can be found here https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now and here https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/
Thanks!

The publication list https://maxlarter.github.io/publications/publications.html is built using code borrowed and modified from Thomas Hackl: https://thackl.github.io/automatically-update-publications-with-R-scholar - thanks for sharing, what a time saver!

Code for the icons in the footer was generated using SVG icon files from https://github.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/tree/master/images/svg
and they were transformed to base64 for insertion into the css file using this tool: https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image/svg
