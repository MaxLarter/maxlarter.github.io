        <h3>Hi there, I'm Max Larter, welcome to my personal website!</h3>
		<p>I'm currently a post-doc in the Smith Lab in at the University of Colorado in Boulder (USA). I'm working on the evolution of the anthocyanin pathway in <i>Iochroma</i>, with a particular focus on the genetic
		mechanisms that underlie phenotypic variation. </p>
		<p>I am a plant ecophysiologist and an evolutionary biologist. My primary research interest is understanding how plants adapt to their environment, and in particular when it is rapidly becoming warmer and with radical changes in rainfall patterns. By examining current trait distributions of living and extinct lineages, we can gain insight into how critical physiological traits have evolved in the past, and what genetic mechanisms have enabled that variation.</p>
		<p>I use a combination of physiological and morphological information, ecological and climatic data in an evolutionary framework to try and answer these questions. </p>
